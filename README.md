In the game you are presented with a sculpture up front. Your goal is to defeat it, but it will not go out without a fight. Projectiles and waves are fired towards you, as a counter attack you can launch a burst bubble that reflects projectiles, but only once you've collected the *zones*. Try set a record and challenge your friends to beat it!
